# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a small JavaScript application that implements the FizzBuzz algorithm. This algorithm is commonly used as an interview exercise to assess developers' ability to write simple and efficient code.

## Features

- Displays numbers from 1 to `n`, replacing some of them with "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" according to the following rules:
  - If the number is divisible by 3, it displays "Fizz".
  - If the number is divisible by 5, it displays "Buzz".
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it displays "FizzBuzz".
  - Otherwise, it simply displays the number.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `fizzbuzz.js` file.

## Usage

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `fizzbuzz.js`.
2. Run the script using the following command:
    - `node fizzBuzz.js [n]`

Replace `[n]` with the number up to which you want to execute FizzBuzz.

## Example

1. To execute FizzBuzz up to 20:
    - `node fizzbuzz.js 20`
    
This will display the FizzBuzz results from 1 to 20 in your terminal.
